* Does the "singleton controller" problem affect me here?
* Add version compatibility badge
* Closure actions?
* Pods?
* `:id` or `:model_id`?
* Going offline
* If you start in a view that loads several records, then go to `index`, the delayed `findAll` will, momentarily, only show the stored records
* Difference between linking to model and model.id
* Default implementation of `model()`
* Guides recommend `rollbackAttributes`
* Update link to guides
* `loading` substate trumps the `loading` route
* What if I trandition during a `loading` event?
